# Kv Store

A lightweight in-memory key-value store written in C with basic crash recovery and remote connection capabilities.

This project is a learning-oriented yet functional implementation of a minimal database-like system â€” think of it as a simplified Redis, built from scratch.

## Features
- In-memory storage for fast access
- Append-only file (AOF) to persist changes and recover from crashes
- Event loop for serving commands from multiple remote clients over TCP without blocking
- Case-insensitive command parsing

## Implementation details

### In-Memory hash table
- Extremely fast lookups but collisions are unavoidable. Chaining was chosen for hash collision resolution after evaluating various alternatives (linear/quadratic probing, Robin Hood hashing, cuckoo hashing). While other methods can offer faster lookups, chaining provides the best balance of simplicity, predictable performance across all operations, and ease of debugging.

- **Hash Function Choice**: DJB2 was chosen for its simplicity, good distribution for small workloads and seemingly random outputs for varied inputs. More robust non-cryptographic hash functions such as MurmurHash, FarmHash, or CityHash provide better distribution and lower collision probability on large datasets. These are planned for future integration to improve scalability and uniformity in key distribution.

### Buffered Append-Only File (AOF)
- Every modifying command (PUT) is first appended to an in memory log buffer which is flushed to disk every 5 secs.
- fsync system call is used to ensure data is physically written to disk, not just sitting in the OS cache.
- Replaying the commands in the log will help to restore the exact state after a crash/failure.
- However, the downside is that the log grows indefinitely. Periodic snapshotting is planned for future implementation. This helps in executing only the commands after the snaphot was taken. (allowing for hybrid approach similar to redis)

### Event Loop
- Chose a single threaded non-blocking event loop to handle multiple client connections without the complexity of having to manage multiple threads.
- Reduces compute load - small, simple, and efficient for a lightweight store.
- Uses TCP sockets for all requests (GET, PUT, PRINT) for reliable communication. However, UDP connection can be used for GET/PRINT requests (similar to memcache) to reduce latency. This is yet to be implemented.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nithinbharathi/kv_store.git
```

2. Build the project
```bash
cd Kv_store
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

3. Run the executable. This starts the server on port 12345
```bash
./kv_store
```

4. Open another terminal and use nc or telnet to connect to the server.
```bash
 nc localhost 12345
```

## Usage
The following operations (case insensitive) are supported:
```
- put key value - store a key value pair
- get key - retrieve the value for a given key
- print - Display all stored key value pairs
```
